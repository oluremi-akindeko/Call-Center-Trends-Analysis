# Introduction
This Power BI project focuses on analyzing call center data for Phone Now (*a fictional telecom company*) in order to track key performance metrics, optimize agent efficiency, and improve customer satisfaction score. By transforming raw data into an interactive dashboard, the project delivers clear insights into call volumes, resolved calls, agent performance, and actual customer satisfaction rating vs targetted rating which empower data-driven decision-making and operational improvement.
# Skills Demonstrated
- Data Cleaning
- Data modelling
- Data Visualization
- DAX measures
- Filters
- Critical Thinking
- Problem Solving
- Interpreting visuals to extract business insights
# Dashboard Goal
The stakeholders had requested that the dashboard show the following metrics:
- Overall customer satisfaction vs target
- Overall calls answered/abandoned
- Calls by month
- Calls by topic
- Average speed of answering calls
- Call center Agent’s performance quadrant
# Data Sourcing
After defining the problem statement, I sourced the dataset by downloading an Excel file from the Forage platform and imported it into Power BI. The dataset covered call center operations for the first quarter of 2021, specifically from January 1 to March 31. I performed data cleaning to ensure accuracy and consistency, followed by in-depth analysis and the development of interactive visualizations to address key business questions and uncover actionable insights.
# Data transformation/Cleaning
The dataset was initially not ready for analysis and required thorough cleaning and transformation before analysis. Using Power BI’s Power Query Editor, the data was efficiently prepared. Ensuring consistency, accuracy, and readiness for visualization.
## Applied data cleaning steps
- Changing Data Types
- Added conditional column for call status
